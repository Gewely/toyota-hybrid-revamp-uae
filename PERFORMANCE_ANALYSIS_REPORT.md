## 🔧 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Performance Fixes (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Animation Optimization
```typescript
// Current: Heavy framer-motion animations
// Target: Reduce motion complexity by 40%

Priority Tasks:
- Replace complex parallax with CSS transforms
- Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth scrolling
- Add motion-reduce preferences support
- Throttle mousemove events to 16ms (60fps)
```

#### 1.2 Code Cleanup & Bundle Optimization
```bash
# Estimated Bundle Size Reduction: 15-25%

Tasks:
- Remove unused component imports (200+ detected)
- Eliminate duplicate dependencies
- Tree-shake lodash and utility libraries
- Convert large components to lazy imports
```

#### 1.3 Image & Media Optimization
```typescript
// Current: Large DAM images without optimization
// Target: 40% faster image loading

Tasks:
- Implement WebP format with fallbacks
- Add responsive image srcSet
- Lazy load gallery images below fold
- Preload critical hero images
```

### Phase 2: Architecture Improvements (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Component Refactoring
```bash
# Large Files Identified for Refactoring:
- AppleStyleStorytellingSection.tsx (659 lines) → Split into 4 components
- VehicleDetails.tsx (432+ lines) → Extract modals and sections
- MobileStickyNav.tsx → Simplify complexity
```

#### 2.2 State Management Optimization
```typescript
// Current: Multiple useState calls causing re-renders
// Target: Reduced render cycles by 60%

Tasks:
- Implement useReducer for complex state
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Optimize context providers
- Add React.memo for pure components
```

#### 2.3 Network & Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Target: 50% faster subsequent page loads

Tasks:
- Implement service worker for asset caching
- Add prefetch for next vehicle in carousel
- Cache API responses with react-query
- Optimize DAM CDN requests
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Virtual Scrolling & Infinite Loading
```typescript
// For large vehicle galleries and lists
- Implement react-window for long lists
- Add intersection observer for lazy sections
- Progressive image loading with blur-up
```

#### 3.2 Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Real-time performance tracking
- Web Vitals dashboard
- User interaction metrics
- Component render profiling
- Network performance insights
```
